### Panic mode
Are you a typical procrastinator? Do you feel bad at yourself because
you can't start working on any duty? Would you like to start working in that very important life-project of yours?

Well, use this script to create a graph of how much time is left for you. You can actually _count_ the
weeks. Black boxes are your lived weeks. White boxes is your expected remaining weeks. Feel the panic. Now get to work.
#### Install
This script requires [Wand](https://pypi.org/project/Wand/) and [svgwrite](https://pypi.org/project/svgwrite/) packages to run. 
Also, [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) library has to be installed. In macOS I used pip3 and [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

Copy the script to any path, edit it for configuring your birth date, and filename output. 
Run the script `panicmode.py` once a week and use the resulting image in your desktop background or wherever you want. 
In macOS I use an Automator script to run it  and [GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/v2/geektool/) to show the image on 
my desktop background.
